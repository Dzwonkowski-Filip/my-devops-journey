# AZ-900: Microsoft Azure Fundamentals

## üìò Learning Path
To prepare for the AZ-900 exam I used a mix of courses, official docs, and practice tests:

1. Udemy ‚Äì Scott Duffy course
   - Solid introduction with hands-on demos
   - Helped me understand basic Azure services and architecture

2. Microsoft Learn ‚Äì Official Learning Paths
   - Modules: cloud concepts, Azure architecture, compute, networking, storage, pricing, support
   - Interactive exercises in Azure portal (sandboxes)

3. Practice tests
   - Microsoft official sample questions - its a lot easier than official exam. 
   - YouTube practice tests (search: AZ-900 practice test ).
